# health_insurance_database_analysis
First, I looked at the dependencies between the variables of the dataset.

From the given table, it can be deduced that the insurance cost of a customer is primarily dependent on their smoking habits, their age, and their BMI.

There appear to be some discrepancies within the data, such as the weak correlation between BMI and charges, and between the number of children and charges. A possible explanation is the lack of adequate data representing different subgroups, for example, customers with more than 3 children. This can lead to differing conclusions than what would be otherwise predicted.
